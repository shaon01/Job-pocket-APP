Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining.
Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[3] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science.
Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[4][5]

In 2012, when Harvard Business Review called it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century",[6] the term "data science" became a buzzword. It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like business analytics,[7] business intelligence, predictive modeling, and statistics. Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing Hans Rosling, featured in a 2011 BBC documentary with the quote, "Statistics is now the sexiest subject around."[8] Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.[9] In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as "data science" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become "dilute[d] beyond usefulness."[10] While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents
